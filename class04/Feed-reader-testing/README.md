# About the tests

## Testing checking the URL is the name

We have a function that checks if there are URLs and names or if it's not done

## Testing Menu

Using jQuery to check if the "body" element has a "menu-hidden" class by default.

Thus, the test should check the tag to verify that the toggleClass function executes correctly.

The click event is used to check if the 'menu-hidden' class exists to ensure the function goes well.

## Testing Initial Entries

Checks if the feed was successfully rendered

## Test New Feed Selection

Checks if there is more than one Feed.

The second feed content must be different from the first feed. Thus, by comparing the rendered HTML content, we can verify that the program loads a different feed with the function instead.
